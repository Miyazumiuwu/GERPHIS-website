            <span class="mini-title">Republic Act No.10354</span><br>
            This is also known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 or RH Law, is an act that provides universal access to reproductive health services like methods of contraception, better family planning, maternal care, and improving public health.
            Women in marginalized communities usually experience unplanned and unwanted pregnancies because they lack education and better guidance from the government, like the shortages of contraceptive supplies from health centers. Inadequate healthcare facilities are also lacking in proper equipment for maternal care, which usually leads to an increase in maternal mortality rates. Moreover, the Philippines has a poor response in acknowledging the implementation of learning sex education in schools, which leads most teenagers to decline the importance of it, resulting in a high teenage pregnancy rate in the country.

            <span class="mini-title">Republic Act No. 7875</span><br>
            Also known as the National Health Insurance Act of 1995, this law provides accessible and affordable healthcare to the Filipino people. One of the objectives of this law is to help and give financial support to Filipinos, especially those in marginalized areas, against high medical costs. The health benefits under this law are the hospitalization coverage of an individual where almost all the hospital expenses are covered. This law can also help pregnant women in terms of their prenatal, child delivery either via cesarean or normal deliveries, and postnatal wherein they might receive lesser expenses from it. This law also helps in family planning wherein there is free access to contraceptives like Vasectomy (Men) and Tubal ligation and IUDs (Women). Additionally, this law also covers treatments for cervical and breast cancers and also STIs.
