            <span class="mini-title">Limited Access to Reproductive Healthcare</span><br>
            Access to reproductive healthcare in the Philippines remains inadequate and unequal, especially those women who belong to the marginalized and lower-income communities. 
            The implementation of the RA 10354, “The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Healthcare Act of 2012” was a significant step toward ensuring that women, most especially mothers have access to reproductive health services, such as family planning, maternal care, and education; however, its enactment did not fully succeed. According to Pasion (2024), the law continues to face numerous challenges, particularly in implementation due to inadequate funding and political resistance. 
            Such barriers make it difficult for healthcare providers to offer services such as prenatal and postnatal care, contraceptives, safe childbirth facilities, and regular gynecological check ups or follow ups. 
            Moreover, as the RH law provides modern contraceptives, access to these still remain limited (Smith, 2014).

            <span class="mini-title">High Maternal Mortality Rate & Unsafe Abortions</span><br>
            In the Philippines, abortion remains illegal under all circumstances. As a result, many women resort to unsafe procedures, which puts their health at risk and premature death of pregnant women and children. The Center of Reproductive Rights estimates that 610,00 Filipino women have induced abortions annually, with at least 1,000 of them dying due to the complications (Finer & Hussain, 2022). This greatly affects teenagers, victims of sexual assault or rape, and low-income women who can not afford private procedures or travel abroad for safer alternatives. With this, it is a significant problem for those women in the Philippines since many can not afford the appropriate and safer method so they are opting to do what is available to them.

            <span class="mini-title">High Teenage Pregnancy Rates & Unintended pregnancies</span><br>
            To this day, the Philippines continues to face increasing high rates of teenage pregnancy which is growing public health and social concern. The Senate Bill (SB) No. 1979, also known as the “Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy Act”, was introduced to educate young people concerning relationships, sex, and reproductive health. However, despite this legislative effort, teenage pregnancy remains a persistent issue and continues to increase each year (Dela Peña, 2025). The lack of a more comprehensive sex education in schools and communities is one of the main causes of this tendency. Many teenage girls are unaware of their reproductive rights and the consequences of unprotected sex which leads to early and unintentionally pregnancy. This further disrupts their education and deprives them from their opportunities in the future.
