            The history of women's reproductive health has been shaped by evolving scientific insights and societal attitudes, with taboos significantly influencing cultural norms and health outcomes. Despite advances in global health education, discussions around sex and reproduction often remain cloaked in secrecy and stigma. Cultural biases contributed to misunderstandings and restricted women's access to medical care. In many societies, menstruation is negatively perceived, with menstrual blood considered unclean, leading to shame and social pressure to conceal it. These framed menstruation as a "hygienic crisis" needing concealment. In medieval Europe, women's voices were excluded from discussions about their bodies, with male physicians dominating the field. Women were marginalized, denied positions of power, and often seen as deceptive or incompetent, which left their needs overlooked.

            These historical taboos continue to affect contemporary society, impacting access to healthcare services, including contraception and safe childbirth. Cultural expectations often compel women to prioritize family honor or adhere to strict moral codes, sometimes at the expense of their health. Adolescence presents additional challenges as young people navigate complex relationships (Leekuan, Kane, Sukwong, & Kulnitichai, 2022). To address these issues, breaking taboos and encouraging open discussions about reproductive health is essential. Educating both men and women about sexual and reproductive health can dismantle harmful stereotypes, empowering women to take charge of their health and ensuring they have the necessary knowledge and resources for a healthy life.
