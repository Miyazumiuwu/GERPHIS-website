            The history of women's reproductive health has been shaped by evolving scientific insights and societal attitudes, with taboos significantly influencing cultural norms and health outcomes. Despite advances in global health education, discussions around sex and reproduction often remain cloaked in secrecy and stigma. Cultural biases contributed to misunderstandings and restricted women's access to medical care. In many societies, menstruation is negatively perceived, with menstrual blood considered unclean, leading to shame and social pressure to conceal it. These framed menstruation as a "hygienic crisis" needing concealment. In medieval Europe, women's voices were excluded from discussions about their bodies, with male physicians dominating the field. Women were marginalized, denied positions of power, and often seen as deceptive or incompetent, which left their needs overlooked.

            These historical taboos continue to affect contemporary society, impacting access to healthcare services, including contraception and safe childbirth. Cultural expectations often compel women to prioritize family honor or adhere to strict moral codes, sometimes at the expense of their health. Adolescence presents additional challenges as young people navigate complex relationships (Leekuan, Kane, Sukwong, & Kulnitichai, 2022). To address these issues, breaking taboos and encouraging open discussions about reproductive health is essential. Educating both men and women about sexual and reproductive health can dismantle harmful stereotypes, empowering women to take charge of their health and ensuring they have the necessary knowledge and resources for a healthy life.

                "I want the law to see women's situation on a case-to-case basis. They should see if continuing pregnancy would mean worsening the woman's situation. Why should a woman bring a child into this world just to suffer?" - Imelda, 30 year old housewife in a family with no steady income of four children

                Reproductive choice has to be straightened out. There will never be a woman of means without choice anymore. That just seems to me so obvious. The states that changed their abortion laws before Roe are not going to change back. So we have a policy that only affects poor women, and it can never be otherwise. - Ruth Bader Ginsburg

                Population growth is straining the Earth's resources to the breaking point, and educating girls is the single most important factor in stabilizing that. That, plus helping women gain political and economic power and safeguarding their reproductive rights. - Al Gore<br><br>
